This folder contains labs and hands-on activities that one can peform to understand end to end AI Pipeline and Operationalizing it at scale using Google Cloud AI Platform.

Lab folder has following artifacts:
  1. Foundational labs are based on BigQuery public data set for epitopes, sourced from IEDB.
  2. Lab book pdf: You can leverage lab book with your GCP account or with trial account. You can ignore login information for qwiklabs unless you are using labs with your qwiklabs account.
  3. Data Science Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks to perform labs, read through lab pdf and notebook instructions.
  4. Datafiles folder contains additional data set that you may want to explore.
  
Key Labs:
  1. Explore and Analyze epotope data with BigQuery and answer key questions on coronavirus peptide vaccine candidates.
  2. Build machine learning model with BigQuery and predict for possible candidates for the vaccine.
  More labs to come:
  a. Build AutoML model and explore through Tensorboard.
  b. Build AI Pipeline using Tensforflow Extension (TFX) framework
  c. Build virus mutation model and generate new peptides.
  d. Leverage virualflow on HPC cluster to predict protein docking with molecule.
 
 Please do share your feedback and suggestion, your experience in learning through these labs.
